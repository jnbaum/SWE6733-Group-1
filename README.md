## Project Overview

This goal of this project is to build an outdoor app (called Rovaly) for adventure seekers. Whether they're into hiking, kayaking, rock climbing, or just exploring new trails, the app matches them with like-minded adventurers who share their passion for the great outdoors. The app goes beyond basic metrics to ensure people find a partner who truly gets their love for adventure.
