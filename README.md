## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build Rovaly, an outdoor app for adventure seekers. Whether they're into hiking, kayaking, rock climbing, or just exploring new trails, the app matches them with like-minded adventurers who share their passion for the great outdoors. By collecting various preferences such as budget, trip length, attitude, and skill level for different adventures, the app ensures people find a partner who truly gets their love for adventure. 
This app is designed specifically to connect users within the Kennesaw, GA area.

## Project Backlog Ordering Rationale

Our team ordered the project backlog with a focus on logical workflow progression and intuitive development flow. We began by grouping related features and tasks according to the typical user journey and core functionality dependencies. This ensures foundational components were prioritized before non-required features. Next, we ordered user stories based on what we perceived as the most natural and efficient route to implementation. We took into account task complexity, team capacity, and cross-feature dependencies. This approach allowed us to maintain flexibility while ensuring that the overall development process remained coherent and streamlined.
